### Inspiration

Scene was recreated entirely in [Rive](https://rive.app/) inspired by the following YouTube tutorials:

- [Windmill Farm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sm-19RBDW9M)
- [Bonfire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5cgbKYH_g)

Game logic and structure couldn't have been completed without referencing the [Sample Project](https://github.com/VGVentures/slide_puzzle)
